# Schedular-Planner

## Description
This code is designed to display a planner that uses third party APIs. Each hour has a block of time that a user can plan their events or work to be done. The application checks the current time to see if what the user has planned has passed. The block is gray if the event has already passed, Red if it is currently time for the event, and Green if it is a future event.
